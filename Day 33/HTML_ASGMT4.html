            <h2>What is pollution?</h2>
            <p>“Pollution is the introduction of substances (or energy) that cause adverse 
                changes in the environment and living entities.”</p>

            <p>Pollution need not always be caused by chemical substances such as particulates
               (like smoke and dust). Forms of energy such as sound, heat or light can also 
               cause pollution. These substances that cause pollution are called pollutants.</p>
                
            <p>Pollution, even in minuscule amounts, impacts the ecological balance.  
               Pollutants can make their way up the food chain and eventually find their 
               way inside the human body. Read on to explore the types of pollution and 
               their implications.</p>

            <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
            <p>Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances
                 in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living 
                 beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.[1] It is also the 
                 contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, 
                 physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the 
                 .There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including 
                 ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and 
                 chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and 
                 biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even
                death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as
                animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment
                (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or
                built environment (for example, acid rain).[3] Air pollution can be caused 
                by both human activities[4] and natural phenomena.</p>
                <p>Air quality is closely related to the earth's climate and ecosystems 
                    globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of 
                    greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.</p>
                    <p>Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of 
                        pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, 
                        heart disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer.[6] [Growing evidence 
                        suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced 
                        IQ scores, impaired cognition,[7] increased risk for psychiatric 
                        disorders such as depression[8] and detrimental perinatal health. 
                        The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but 
                        principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular 
                        system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of 
                        pollutant a person is exposed to,[10][11] the degree of exposure, and 
                        the individual's health status and genetics.</p>

            <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
            <p>Water pollution, the release of substances into subsurface groundwater or into lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, and oceans to the point where the substances interfere with beneficial use of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems. In addition to the release of substances, such as chemicals, trash, or microorganisms, water pollution may also include the release of energy, in the form of radioactivity or heat, into bodies of water.</p>
            <P>Water bodies can be polluted by a wide variety of substances, including pathogenic microorganisms, putrescible organic waste, fertilizers and plant nutrients, toxic chemicals, sediments, heat, petroleum (oil), and radioactive substances. Several types of water pollutants are considered below. (For a discussion of the handling of sewage and other forms of waste produced by human activities, see waste disposal and solid-waste management.)</P>
            <P>Water pollutants come from either point sources or dispersed sources. A point source is a pipe or channel, such as those used for discharge from an industrial facility or a city sewerage system. A dispersed (or nonpoint) source is a very broad unconfined area from which a variety of pollutants enter the water body, such as the runoff from an agricultural area. Point sources of water pollution are easier to control than dispersed sources, because the contaminated water has been collected and conveyed to one single point where it can be treated. Pollution from dispersed sources is difficult to control, and, despite much progress in the building of modern sewage-treatment plants, dispersed sources continue to cause a large fraction of water pollution problems.</P>

            <h2>Soil Pollution</h2>
            <p>Soil pollution refers to the contamination of soil with anomalous concentrations of toxic substances.</p>

            <p>It is a serious environmental concern since it harbours many health hazards. For example, exposure to soil containing high concentrations of benzene increases the risk of contracting leukaemia. An image detailing the discolouration of soil due to soil pollution is provided below.</p>
            <p>It is important to understand that all soils contain compounds that are harmful/toxic to human beings and other living organisms. However, the concentration of such substances in unpolluted soil is low enough that they do not pose any threat to the surrounding ecosystem. When the concentration of one or more such toxic substances is high enough to cause damage to living organisms, the soil is said to be contaminated.</p>

        <section id="fifth_topic">
            <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
            <p>Noise pollution, or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise or sound with ranging impacts on the activity of human or animal life, most of which are harmful to a degree. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport and propagation systems.[1][2][3] Poor urban planning may give rise to noise disintegration or pollution, side-by-side industrial and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas. Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include loud music, transportation (traffic, rail, airplanes, etc.), lawn care maintenance, construction, electrical generators, wind turbines, explosions and people.</p>
            <p>Documented problems associated with noise in urban environments go back as far as ancient Rome.[4] Research suggests that noise pollution in the United States is the highest in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods,[5] and noise pollution associated with household electricity generators is an emerging environmental degradation in many developing nations.</p>
            <p>High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects in humans and an increased incidence of coronary artery disease.[7][8] In animals, noise can increase the risk of death by altering predator or prey detection and avoidance, interfere with reproduction and navigation, and contribute to permanent hearing loss.[9] A substantial amount of the noise that humans produce occurs in the ocean. Up until recently, most research on noise impacts has been focused on marine mammals, and to a lesser degree, fish.[10][11] In the past few years, scientists have shifted to conducting studies on invertebrates and their responses to anthropogenic sounds in the marine environment. This research is essential, especially considering that invertebrates make up 75% of marine species, and thus compose a large percentage of ocean food webs.[11] Of the studies that have been conducted, a sizable variety in families of invertebrates have been represented in the research. A variation in the complexity of their sensory systems exists, which allows scientists to study a range of characteristics and develop a better understanding of anthropogenic noise impacts on living organisms.</p>
